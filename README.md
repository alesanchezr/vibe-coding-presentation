# vibe-coding-presentation

I in the middle of a live presentation and I forgot to make my powerpoint slides, I want you to make some slides for me that I can share a live link with my audience that they can open on their phones. The slides will all be in sync in all the devices, we can use a socket, and I'm able to pass the slide for everyone. 
Use the slide templates in this image to inspire and copy your own designs:

I have launched more than 25 diferent companies, in almost all of them I have been very actively coding and building the product with at least 1,000 hours of work on each. ![IMG_0115](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b9feb9c-d108-405e-8ae0-8038f9577c3f)

One of the products I first launched was called IVoted.com, it was based in SF and backed by one of the biggest entrepreneurs and it was an Audience Response System that took us 6 months to build. It was a very simple idea to create polls that can receive answers in real time.

First attempt.

```Speaker notes not to be includes in the slide
I'm in the middle of a speaking presentation, create a lighweight poll app using a minimalistic UI that prompts me for a question, it allows my to enter multiple possible answer options and when I submit it  creates a link I can share with my audience to answer the question, it should also give me a QR code I can share with the audience. The app should be mobile first. Once people vote, they need to see the results immediately, in real time.
```

But why not kill the entire Audience response system industry?

-- New Slide --

The global Audience Response System (ARS) market, encompassing tools like live polling, real-time feedback, and interactive engagement platforms, was valued at approximately $1.5 billion in 2023. Projections indicate growth to $2.9 billion by 2031.

First attempt.

Can we include sms answers? we assigned a unique english-like word to each possible option and the audience is able to text that keyword to a number.
The keywords to send need to be displaed on the shared link were people click actually vote. Make sure the phone number is big and visiible.
Include the qr code and the phone number on the live results as well so I can keep that screen on the big screen for people to see.
Also make sure the keywords are displayed in the voting screen, and the phone number which is +18336090355
