```Speaker notes not to be includes in the slide
I'm in the middle of a speaking presentation, create a lighweight poll app using a minimalistic UI that prompts me for a question, it allows my to enter multiple possible answer options and when I submit it  creates a link I can share with my audience to answer the question, it should also give me a QR code I can share with the audience. The app should be mobile first. Once people vote, they need to see the results immediately, in real time.

Heading: 2 hours of prompting lead me to this image.

This is the caption for the image: `This Baroque-style painting portrays the Vibe Coder as a divine figure radiating light, standing atop tangled network cables and scattered money, symbolizing both connection and reward. He is revered by marketers, investors, and users who surround him with adoration, while demonic forces like a hacker, a monstrous bug, and the procrastination demon Belphegor loom in the shadows. Above, glowing clouds hint at AI and server power, elevating coding to an act of modern divinity.`

But why not kill the entire Audience response system industry?

-- New Slide --

The global Audience Response System (ARS) market, encompassing tools like live polling, real-time feedback, and interactive engagement platforms, was valued at approximately $1.5 billion in 2023. Projections indicate growth to $2.9 billion by 2031.

First attempt.

Can we include sms answers? we assigned a unique english-like word to each possible option and the audience is able to text that keyword to a number.
The keywords to send need to be displaed on the shared link were people click actually vote. Make sure the phone number is big and visiible.
Include the qr code and the phone number on the live results as well so I can keep that screen on the big screen for people to see.
Also make sure the keywords are displayed in the voting screen, and the phone number which is +18336090355

<h1>How I plan for marketing</h1>

```prompt
Hello, I want to create a cursor coding project, that will be used for generating marketing content for diferent purposes like:

- Social media posts on X
- Social media posts on linkedin
- Blog posts
- Change log

Each social network has a different strategy, I want you to write a suggested a strategy for each of channels, save it as a cursor rule so we can automatically use it when writing posts for the respective channel.

Ideally I can be working on my product and as thoughts and ideas come to my mind I can tell you and you make on how to translate them into each of the channels, for example: Creating scheduling multiple x posts about that, wiring one long for post for LinkedIn in or including updates into the product changelog.

I want it to be able to take screenshots of my computer when I tell it so, and attach them to the content being generated.

Write an implementation plan first called "implementation.md"
```
